Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer 
may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, 
fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of 
skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, 
swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin Breast cancer most 
commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that 
supply these ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as 
ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular 
carcinomas There are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some, 
such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The 
diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning 
tissue. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the 
cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be 
effective.
